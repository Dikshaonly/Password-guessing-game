# Password Guessing Game

This repository contains a simple password guessing game implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The application uses a dataset of the most commonly used passwords stored in a CSV file. The user has multiple attempts to guess one of these common passwords.

## Files

- `common_passwords.csv`: A CSV file containing a list of the most commonly used passwords.
- `password_guessing_game.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that implements the password guessing application.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-guessing-app.git
    cd password-guessing-app
    ```

2. Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, install it using pip.

    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook password_guessing_app.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to start the password guessing application.

## Common Passwords Dataset

The `common_passwords.csv` file contains a list of the most commonly used passwords. This dataset is used to check the user's guesses in the application.

## Example

Here's an example of what the application looks like when running:

```
Welcome to the Password Guessing Game!
